## Hi there 👋 

I'm Samarth, an Electronics Engineer focused on VLSI Design & Functional Verification.

I mostly work on Digital Design and Verification — SystemVerilog, UVM, RTL design, and assertion-based verification.

I use EDA tools for simulation, debugging, and coverage-driven verification of digital IPs.

This profile is where I share my verification projects, UVM environments, RTL designs, and experiments. Everything here is built for learning and real engineering practice.
